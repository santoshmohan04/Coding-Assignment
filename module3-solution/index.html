                        <p>A popular south indian breakfast recipe made with ground urad dal and idli rava batter.
                            Served with the combination of chutney recipes and sambar recipes.
                            Idly are a type of savoury rice cake, originating from the Indian subcontinent, popular as breakfast foods in Southern India and among Tamils in Sri Lanka.
                            The cakes are made by steaming a batter consisting of fermented black lentils (de-husked) and rice.
                            The fermentation process breaks down the starches so that they are more readily metabolized by the body.
                            Idly has several variations, including rava idli, which is made from semolina. Regional variants include sanna of Konkan.
                            To make Idli, four parts uncooked rice (Idli rice or parboiled rice) to one part whole white lentil (black gram, Vigna mungo) are soaked separately for at least four hours to six hours or overnight.
                            Optionally spices such as fenugreek seeds can be added at the time of soaking for additional flavour. Once done soaking, the lentils are ground to a fine paste and the rice is separately coarsely ground, then they are combined.
                            Next, the mixture is left to ferment overnight during which its volume will more than double.
                            After fermentation some of the batter may be kept as a starter culture for the next batch.
                            The finished idli batter is put into greased moulds of an idli tray or "tree" for steaming.
                            The perforated molds allow the idlis to be cooked evenly.
                            The tree holds the trays above the level of boiling water in a pot, and the pot is covered until the idlis are done (about 10â€“25 minutes, depending on size).
                            A more traditional method is to use leaves instead of moulds.

						<section id = "Luchai Puri">
                        <h4 class= "text-center">Luchai Puri</h4>
                        <p>A traditional and authentic bengali deep fried puffed bread recipe made with plain flour.
                           The recipe is very similar to a traditional poori recipe but just that this recipe is made with maida and ghee.
                            The striking feature of this recipe is its texture and white bright colour which makes it attractive and appealing.
                            Puri (also spelled Poori) is a deep-fat fried bread made from unleavened whole-wheat flour that originated in the Indian subcontinent.
                            It is eaten for breakfast or as a snack or light meal.
                            It is usually served with a savory curry or bhaji, as in puri bhaji, but may also be eaten with sweet dishes.
                            Puris are most commonly served as breakfast and snacks.
                            It is also served at special or ceremonial functions as part of ceremonial rituals along with other vegetarian food offered in prayer as prasadam.
                            Puris are prepared with wheat flour, either atta (whole wheat flour) or sooji (coarse wheat flour).
                            In some recipes, ajwain, cumin seed, spinach, or fenugreek seeds are added to the dough.
                            The dough is either rolled out in a small circle or rolled out and cut out in small circles, then deep fried in ghee or vegetable oil.
                            While deep frying, puris puff up like a round ball because moisture in the dough changes into steam which expands in all directions.
                            When they are golden-brown in color, they are removed and either served hot or saved for later use (as with the snack food pani puri).
                            Rolled puris may be pricked with a fork before deep frying to make flat puris for chaat like bhel puri.
                            A punctured puri does not puff when cooked because the steam escapes as it cooks.

						<h4 class= "text-center">Tuppa Dosa</h4>
                        <p>A tasty and flavoured dosa recipe made with the traditional dosa batter with a generous amount of ghee.
                            It is basically an extension to the traditional dosa with an extra topping of clarified butter to make it more flavoured and tasty.
                            It is generally served with a range of chutney recipes but can also be served with choice of curries for morning breakfast and also for lunch and dinner.
                            A dosa is a rice pancake, originating from South India, made from a fermented batter.
                            It is somewhat similar to a crepe in appearance.
                            Its main ingredients are rice and black gram, ground together in a fine, smooth batter with a dash of salt.
                            Dosas are a typical part of diets throughout South India street foodie official, but the dish is now popular all over the Indian subcontinent.
                            Traditionally, dosas are served hot along with sambar and chutney. They can be consumed with idli podi as well.
                            A mixture of rice and black gram that has been soaked in water is ground finely to form a batter.
                            Some add a handful of soaked fenugreek seeds.
                            The proportion of rice to lentils is generally 3:1 or 4:1.

                            It is spread out with the base of a ladle or bowl to form a pancake.
                            It can be made either to be thick like a pancake, or thin and crispy.
                            A dosa is served hot, either folded in half or rolled like a wrap.
